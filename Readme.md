# Project Title: Weather Forecast Application Development in JavaScript

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to develop a weather forecast application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application should retrieve weather data from an API, display it in a user-friendly interface, and provide essential features such as location-based forecasts, current weather conditions, and extended forecasts.

## Tasks

### 1. Set Up Project Structure (5 marks)
- Create the basic project structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. ✅
- Use **Tailwind CSS** in this project.
- Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) for tracking changes throughout development.

### 2. Integration with Weather API (10 marks)
- Research and select a suitable weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.). ✅

### 3. User Interface (UI) Design (25 marks)
- Design a simple and intuitive user interface using HTML and Tailwind CSS. *(10 marks)* ✅
- Ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes: 
  - **Desktop**
  - **iPad Mini**
  - **iPhone SE** *(15 marks - 5 marks on each screen)*

### 4. Location-Based Forecast (100 marks)
- Allow users to search for weather forecasts by **city name**. *(15 marks)* ✅
- Allow users to search weather forecasts for **current location**. *(15 marks)*
- Add user interaction features such as buttons and input fields for selecting locations and viewing different weather data. *(10 marks)*
- Implement dropdown menu for **recently searched cities**:
  - Use **local or session storage** to store recently searched cities.
  - Initially, the dropdown should be empty.
  - Clicking on any city in the dropdown menu should update the weather data. *(20 marks)*
- Implement event listeners to handle user interactions and update the UI accordingly. *(10 marks)*
- Validate user inputs to prevent errors (e.g., invalid location, empty search queries). *(10 marks)*
- Fetch and display **location-specific weather forecasts**: ✅
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed *(15 marks)*
- Use appropriate icons or graphics to represent weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy). *(5 marks)*

### 5. Extended Forecast Display (30 marks)
- Implement functionality to display **extended weather forecasts** for multiple days (e.g., 5-day forecast). *(15 marks)* ✅
- Organize forecast data into a visually appealing and easy-to-read format: ✅
  - Date
  - Icon
  - Temperature
  - Wind speed
  - Humidity *(15 marks)*

### 6. Error Handling and Validation (20 marks)
- Handle API errors gracefully and display appropriate error messages to users.

### 7. Documentation (5 marks)
- Document the codebase, including comments and a **README.md** file detailing setup instructions and usage.

## Deliverables
- Completed weather forecast application with all specified features implemented.
- **GitHub repository** containing the project code with version control history. *(5 marks)*
